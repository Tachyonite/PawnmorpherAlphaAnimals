        mutagen defs store information about what can and cannot recieve mutations
    as well as information about what kind of effects recieving mutations from this source 
    gives 

        MutagenDef contains the below field for setting what kinds of aspects it gives and how it gives them
        <aspectGivers>
            <li Class="Pawnmorph.Aspects.RandomGiver">
                <entries>
                    <li>
                        <!-- on average this would require 20 mutations to give  -->
                        <aspect>Paragon</aspect>
                        <chance>0.05</chance>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <aspect>Afflicted</aspect>
                        <chance>0.05</chance>
                    </li>
                </entries>
            </li>
            <li Class="Pawnmorph.Aspects.SkillBasedGiver">
                <aspect>AnimalAffinity</aspect>
                <skillDef>Animals</skillDef>
                <skillThreshold>3</skillThreshold> <!-- pawn must have the Animals skills above 3 to get this  -->
                <chance>0.07</chance>
            </li>
        </aspectGivers>
    </Pawnmorph.MutagenDef>
    Mutagens can be attached to several things to alter how they give mutations, the 2 right now are HediffDefs and DamageDefs
    <HediffDef>
        <defName>SomeMorphHediffDef</defName>
        normal hediff def stuff goes here
        <modExtensions>
            <li Class="Pawnmorph.DefExtensions.MutagenExtension">
                <mutagen>Example</mutagen>
            </li>
            you can also add the following mod extension to add aditional aspect givers to the Morph transformation hediff
            <li Class="Pawnmorph.DefExtensions.AspectGiverExtension">
                <aspectGivers>
                    <li Class="Pawnmorph.Aspects.SkillBasedGiver">
                        <aspect>PlantAffinity</aspect>
                        <skillDef>Plants</skillDef>
                        <skillThreshold>5</skillThreshold> <!-- pawn must have the Plants skills above 5 to get this  -->
                        <chance>0.07</chance>
                    </li>
                </aspectGivers>
            </li>
        </modExtensions>
        now this example hediff can apply all aspects in the example mutagen as well as the additional ones provided by the AspectGiverExtension 
        Something to keep in mind that a morph transformation hediff can have only one mutagen source, but as many AspectGiverExtensions as you want
    </HediffDef>
    DamageDefs that have the mutagenic injury damage worker or other special workers can also be given MutagenDefs so they can have a chance of apply aspects when 
    they cause a pawn to mutate
    <DamageDef ParentName="BluntBase">
        ...
        <modExtensions>
            <li Class="Pawnmorph.Damage.MutagenicDamageExtension">
                ...
                <mutagen>Example</mutagen>
            </li>
        </modExtensions>
    </DamageDef>

</Defs>
