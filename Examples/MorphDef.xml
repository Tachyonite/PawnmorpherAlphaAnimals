        list of different 'categories' this morph falls into, like combat, production, etc. 
        the categories defined in the base mod are listed below, you can also define your own by making 
        new MorphCategoryDefs (only relavent fields are defName and label) 
        
        the categories defined in PMCore: 
        Powerful,Combat,Production,Reptile,Social,Canid,Crafter,Chimera
        
        note: Canid and reptile should considered depricated

        the animal this morph is a hybrid of, this race is used to generate the hybrid race by (mostly) averaging 
        the stats of the animal and human   
        <race>AnimalRace</race>

        this is the classification this morph falls into, this is used to determine what mutations this morph gets 
        for example WolfMorph is under the 'Canid' class and so inherit all canid specific mutations as well as mutations specific 
        to the WolfMorph 

        if you define mutations that conflict with a more general mutation, for example define fur specific to your morph, the morph will keep 
        the more specific mutation and ignore the general one 
        <classification>AnimalClassDef</classification>
        
        optional field to define a 'Group' this morph falls into. 'Groups' are used when you want to give a morph bonuses/drawbacks based 
        on how many morphs or animals the colony has of the same group. For example canine morphs are happier the more canine are around 
        The only groups available in core are Canines, and HerbivoreHerding but you can define more morph groups yourself 
        see MorphGroup.xml example
        <group>MorphGroup</group>

        this is where you specify the various settings for the hybrid race of this morph 
        <raceSettings>

        </raceSettings>

        this is where you specify extra stuff when a pawn turns into a hybrid race or reverts back to human  
        <transformSettings>
            a list of additional stat modifiers you would like to add onto the morph other then those specified in

            if you want to make your own hybrid race from start use this field, this morph will then use 
            the given race as it's hybrid and most other fields will be ignored  
            <explicitHybridRace>ExplicitHybrid</explicitHybridRace>

            if you use an explicit hybrid race and set this to true this will copy all HAR body addions from 
            human onto the explicit race
            <transferHumanBodyAddons>true/false</transferHumanBodyAddons>
