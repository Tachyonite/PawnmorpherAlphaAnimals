        value used to influence the order in which rules are checked 
        lower values are checked before higher ones, and only one rule will be successfully executed on a pawn 
        at a time
        <priority>10</priority>
        mean time (in days) it takes for the rule to trigger once the conditions have been met  
        a zero or negitive value will make the rule trigger as soon as the conditions are met

        list of conditions that must be met before the rule can execute

        this is a list of aspect conditions for this rule

                if set, then the aspect def must be this stage on a given pawn to satisfy this condition
