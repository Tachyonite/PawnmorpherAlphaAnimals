                the group def extensions is for adding a list of alternatives for a specific thought 
                note, this extension does *not* work for situational thoughts, only memories 
                
                this is a list of possible alternatives for the attached ThoughtDef 
                the thought actually given is chosen by starting the beginning of the list, and picking the first thought 
                that is valid for a given pawn, so they should always be ordered in most specific to most general  
                the thought's restricted/required traits are checked, as well as any DefRestrictions (see DefRestrictions.xml) 
                the thought might have attached 
                if no thought in the below list is valid for a pawn the original thought is given,assuming it's valid for the pawn
